# ANGELDOLLFACE.JS :dolls: :ribbon:

***An NPX greeting card! :dolls: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

After trawling through GitHub for some inspiration for my GitHub profile `README`, I saw someone making a greeting card for themselves using NPX. I thought this to be a cool idea and a bit edgy so here's mine. :heart_on_fire:

## USAGE :hammer:

Make sure you have Node.js installed and available from the command line!
To run my greeting card, simply run the command below:

```bash
npx git+https://github.com/angeldollface/angeldollface.js
```
